## Terminology

* batch size 
* epoch

## Important considerations

What should be the batch_size?
Gradient descent vs stochastic gradient descent vs mini-batch gradient descent

## Common questions


## Checklist

- [x] Classification (normally distributed clusters)
- [ ] Plot learning curve of model vaildation error against training time
- [ ] Tune batch size and learning rate
