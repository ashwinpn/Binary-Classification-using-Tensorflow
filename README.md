## Terminology

* Batch Size
  It is a hyperparameter which defines the number of samples the algorithm would work through before the internal parameters are updated.
* Epoch
  Number of epochs reflects the number of iterations the learning algorithm will undergo while working through the entire dataset.
* Perceptrons
  A machine learning construct usually used for classification tasks.
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
  When the batch_size = 1.
* Batch Gradient Descent
  When epoch = 1.

## Important considerations

* What should be the batch_size?
* Gradient descent vs stochastic gradient descent vs mini-batch gradient descent

## Checklist

- [x] Classification (normally distributed clusters)
- [ ] Plot learning curve of model vaildation error against training time
- [ ] Tune batch size and learning rate
